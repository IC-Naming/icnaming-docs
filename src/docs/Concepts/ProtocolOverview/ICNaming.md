# IC Naming     

ICNaming is a Decentralized Domain Name Server based on Dfinity network, which accomplishes the basic functions of Domain Name Server by decentralized method, also an on-chain server corresponding to IP address and wallet address on Dfinity.

ICNaming is built on a canister, which is a smart contract running on IC network and can be connected by SDK on IC network when you utilize Dapp.Same with DNS, ICNaming can reflect the complicated wallet address to customized short address such as 123.icp、NFT.icp etc. Users can utilize ICNaming domain to bind with wallet and transfer tokens. In the future ICNaming can cooperate with traditional DNS such as .com.cn.io etc.

Compared with DNS, ICNaming is based on decentralized governance method which completely prevents the risk of wall pollution. The domain name will be custodied by users and each domain can be regarded as NFT which can be traded and auctioned in ICNaming. It means a lot to Dfinity ecosystem.

Along with completing the Dfinity ecosystem, we believe there will be more and more users coming to ICNaming in the future. Compared with current decentralized domain name systems, ICNaming is more safer and convenient with lower gas fee and governance fee. The most important is that ICNaming is with more advantages with characteristics and technologies of Dfinity, in this case it’s with more investment values.

We believe that ICNaming will collect the advantages of various decentralized domain name systems and upgrade functions internally, it will develop Dfinity eco rabidly and become the key carrier of user’s digital identity in Web 3.0.
